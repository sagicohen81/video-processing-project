# video-processing-project
In this project we extracted and copied a moving object (human) from outdoor video to synthetic background. We used techniques of background stabilizing, background subtraction, diffusion from scribble points, particle filter tracing and matting.

Although our final results are not quite good as commercial programs that implement the same task, we think that a lot can be learnt from each task/function represented in this git.
